CS23710 Assignment 1 - Relocate Aberystwyth Diary Company
=========================================================

A copy of a system I wrote for an assignment in my second year of university (2010).

Note the library file (`lib/libdap_shortest.a`) was compiled against SunOS 5.10 as part of this assignment.


Running
-------

See the man file for more details (./relocate -h or --help)

It should be noted that the files are best stored in the same directory as all the links are relative to the program and not the file.
